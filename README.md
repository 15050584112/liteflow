## Overview
liteFlow is a lightweight , fast component-based process engine framework / rules engine , component orchestration , component reuse , to help decouple business code , so that each business fragment is an elegant component , and support hot-loading rule configuration , to achieve on-the-fly modification .

## Feature
* **Component definition unified:** All logic is a component, for all logic to provide a unified component implementation, small size, large energy.
* **Rules lightweight:** based on the rules file to arrange the process, learning the rules entry only takes 5 minutes, a read both understand.
* **Rule diversification:** rules support XML, JSON, YML three rule file writing methods, which you like to use.
* **Arbitrary arrangement:** Synchronous asynchronous mixing, no matter how complex the logic process, using LiteFlow rules, are easy to do, see the rules file to see how the logic works.
* **Rules can be loaded from anywhere:** The framework provides implementations of local file configuration sources and ZK configuration sources, as well as an extension interface that allows you to store rules anywhere.
* **Elegant hot refresh mechanism:** Rule changes, instant change of application rules without restarting your application. High concurrency does not cause any errors in executing rules due to refreshing rules.
* **Wide support:** LiteFlow works regardless of whether your project is built on Springboot, Spring, or any other Java framework.
* **JDK support:** From JDK8 to JDK17. Don't worry about JDK versions.
* **Scripting language support:** Scripting language nodes can be defined, supporting both QLExpress and Groovy scripting. More scripting languages will be supported in the future.
* **Rule nesting support:** You can use simple expressions to create multiple nested complex logic layouts if you want.
* **Component retry support:** Components can support retry, and each component can customize the retry configuration and specify exceptions.
* **Context isolation mechanism:** Reliable context isolation mechanism, you do not have to worry about high concurrency data flow.
* **Declarative component support:** You can make any of your classes become components in seconds.
* **Detailed step information:** How your link performs, how much time each component takes, what errors are reported at a glance.
* **Stable and reliable:** has been iterating for more than 2 years, running stably on the core systems of major companies.
* **Excellent performance:** the framework itself consumes little extra performance, depending on the efficiency of your component execution.
* **Built-in simple monitoring:** Built-in a command line monitoring framework, you can know the running time ranking of each component.
